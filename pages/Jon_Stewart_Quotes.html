“Yes, the long war on Christianity. I pray that one day we may live in
an America where Christians can worship freely! In broad daylight!
Openly wearing the symbols of their religion... perhaps around their
necks? And maybe -- dare I dream it? -- maybe one day there can be an
openly Christian President. Or, perhaps, 43 of them. Consecutively.”

“Thomas Jefferson once said: 'Of course the people don't want war. But
the people can be brought to the bidding of their leader. All you have
to do is tell them they're being attacked and denounce the pacifists for
somehow a lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It
works the same in any country.' I think that was Jefferson. Oh wait.
That was Hermann Goering. Shoot."

“It's funny. When we were alive we spent much of our time staring up at
the cosmos and wondering what was out there. We were obsessed with the
moon and whether we could one day visit it. The day we finally walked on
it was celebrated worldwide as perhaps man's greatest achievement. But
it was while we were there, gathering rocks from the moon's desolate
landscape, that we looked up and caught a glimpse of just how incredible
our own planet was. Its singular astonishing beauty. We called her
Mother Earth. Because she gave birth to us, and then we sucked her dry.”
